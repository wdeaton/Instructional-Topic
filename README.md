## Intro ##

When you look at a calf, what do you see? Besides the cute face and adorableness of
a newborn animal. You see an animal. Now, how old is that newborn? Who is their
mother, their father, or have they been vaccinated for newborn diseases? Better
yet, what is that animals name. I would like to explain and go over
protocols for processing a calf, and registering it, so we can answer all these questions and help
the calf grow into a strong and healthy animal. This process is typical for
newborns, and at the College of the Ozarks beef farm, our cattle are
registered. This means that all our cattle have names, numbers, and records of
everything they have had done. The first step in registering any animal is the
processing they get after being born. 

  The most crucial step when processing calves is to watch the mother and her newborn. You do not want to process the calf if it has ambiotic fluid on it. This means that the mother has not had enough time to bond with her calf. When approaching the pair, approach carefully. If you are close enough to see if the calf has ambiotic fluid, then your close enough for the mother to hurt you. If she lets you approach and the calf is dry, then you can begin processing. 
  Before processing, run a mental checklist before you get to the calf to make sure you have all your gear ready. The calf then gets a vaccine via the nose and mouth, a tag in thier left ear for identification, get a weight, spray for screwworm, and get the gender of the calf. The vaccines help the calf fight off newborn diseases while boosting its' immunity to future diseases. The tag will have a College of the Ozarks stamp in it as well as a number for easy identification. The weight and gender of the calf are for records and the screwworm spray helps keeps flies off the naval and posterior end of the calf. Now you are ready to insert information into records. 
  Records are vital in determing the direction of your operation. It is crucial for the registration of your animal. To fill the records, you need to get the cows condition, score the udder and teats, determine calving ease, enter in all the information about the calf previously recorded, and include sire number. A cows condition is what the animal looks like after calving for example: is she fat, skinny, or in between? To score an udder with teats, it is close to the conditioning score, does it look too big, small, or in between. Calving ease is just asking if she did, or did not, need help. Then after the previous calf information is recorded, include the sire number( sire means father).
  All of this information recorded from the mother, father, and newborn create the babies final step in processing. A pedigree is a data sheet that tells the past, present, and future of that animal.

In registered herds, much of this information is kept in records for the owner to
access or for when the animal is sold. This information is printed off and
handed to the next owner. However, none of this is possible without processing
the calf. It is critical to get those early vaccinations administered for the
health and safety of the calf and the herd. The statistics from the new born
calves help us identify the motherly characters that can be genetically passed
on.
