## Intro ##

When you look at a calf, what do you see? Besides the cute face and adorableness of
a newborn animal. You see an animal. Now, how old is that newborn? Who is their
mother, their father, or have they been vaccinated for newborn diseases? Better
yet, this animal even has a name. Today I would like to explain and go over
protocols for processing a calf so we can answer all these questions and help
the calf grow into a strong and healthy animal. This process is typical for
newborns, and at the College of the Ozarks beef farm, our cattle are
registered. This means that all our cattle have names, numbers, and records of
everything they have had done. The first step in registering any animal is the
processing they get after being born. 

## Paragraph 1 ##

- How long you wait until the calf has met mother and is strong enough for processing. 
- Approach carefully
- Catch baby and start processing

## Paragraph 2 ##

- One oral and one intranasular vaccine given
- Tag the left ear with a cofo stamped ear tag for identification
- Get weight
- Spray screwworm spray for naval and butt
- Check to see if bull or heifer

## Paragraph 3 ##

- Get records book and insert information
- Cow condition, udder, teat, and calving ease
- Calf number, weight, date of birth, and sex
- Sire number

## Paragraph 4 ##

- Insert information into cattlemax which updates mother, father, calf information
- Talk about how this effects epds
- Thatâ€™s the process and what it does

## Conclusion ##

In registered herds, much of this information is kept in records for the owner to
access or for when the animal is sold. This information is printed off and
handed to the next owner. However, none of this is possible without processing
the calf. It is critical to get those early vaccinations administered for the
health and safety of the calf and the herd. The statistics from the new born
calves help us identify the motherly characters that can be genetically passed
on.
