# Instructional-Topic

My topic for the Instructional paper is going to be about processing calves. At the College of the Ozarks beef farm, we have a specfic processing technique to identify our calves. This processing gives the calf a name and number, its first immunization vaccines, and we can then acquire certain information needed to register the calf.
