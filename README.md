# Instructional-Topic


My topic for the Instructional paper is going to be about processing calves. At the College of the Ozarks beef farm, we have a specfic processing technique to identify our calves. This processing gives the calf a name and number, its first immunization vaccines, and we can then acquire certain information needed to register the calf. Registering calves is necessary to complete the Hereford Registraion paperwork for hereford animals.
